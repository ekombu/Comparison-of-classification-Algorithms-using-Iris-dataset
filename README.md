# Comparison-of-classification-Algorithms-using-Iris-dataset
In this example, I compare a logistic regression, decision tree classification, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes,SVM and random forest classification result using the popular iris dataset from seaborn package.   Lesson learnt: Naive Bayes algorithm returns 100% accuracy while others return 97.36% accuracy.
